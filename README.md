# LetsFindYourDEM
This script helps you locate the Digital Elevation Data (DEM) files for your area of interest. The DEM data is sourced from https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ and must be downloaded in advance. By simply entering the latitude and longitude coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of your area of interest, the script will retrieve the relevant DEM files and save them to the output folder.


###NOTICE！！！###

The files in the Global_DEM_tif_file folder(Please extract the files beforehand to avoid errors.) are only placeholder files in the uploaded version due to size limitations. Before using the script, you need to download the DEM files in advance, extract them, and replace the placeholders.You can download the DEM files using the download_Dem.sh script located in the folder.
